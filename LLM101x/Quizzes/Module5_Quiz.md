- [x] Morgan's birthday part had over 10 friends.


**7.** Which of the following model issues result in hallucination? Select three.
- [x] Encoder learns wrong correlations between parts of training data
- [x] Decoder attends to the wrong part of the input source
- [x] Model generates output based on its own self-generated sequence
- [ ] The model learns from the provided input


**8.** Which of the following is NOT true about evaluating hallucination?
- [ ] There can be subjective nuances to evaluate if particular statements are toxic or factual or not.
- [x] Evaluating hallucination can be straightforward when we use mathematical equations to quantify it.
- [ ] When we use another model to evaluate hallucination, the model itself can be flawed as well.
- [ ] Many outputs require manual human verification.


**9.** True or False: It is sufficient to mitigate hallucination by improving data quality alone.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

**10.** True or False: Implementing AI regulatory standards alone will mitigate LLM risks and limitations.
- [ ] True
- [x] False
